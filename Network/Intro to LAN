Today I focused on understanding Local Area Networks (LANs) as part of my cybersecurity foundation.
Even without premium labs, I’m learning the concepts manually and practicing on my Linux machine.
What I learned
What a LAN is and how devices communicate inside a local network
Private vs Public IP addresses
Role of routers, switches, and access points
How DHCP assigns IP addresses automatically
How devices find each other using ARP
Basic troubleshooting with ping and traceroute
Hands-on practice
Commands I tested:
ip a
ip route
ping 8.8.8.8
traceroute google.com
arp -a
netstat -tulnp

Key takeaway
Understanding how traffic moves inside a LAN makes:
troubleshooting easier
packet analysis clearer
SOC investigations faster
Cybersecurity starts with strong networking fundamentals.
Slow and consistent learning every day.
